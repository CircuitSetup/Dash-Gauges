&#9888; The measurements in the PNG files are proven to be accurate, bezels were made based on those. The DWG files were made based on the measurements in the PNGs but were not yet used to produce bezels. Please check the DWGs on paper before having the bezel made in metal. If you find errors, please open an issue or a discussion thread. If you want to save yourself the trouble, you can buy the complete bezel at [CircuitSetup](https://circuitsetup.us/product/delorean-time-machine-dash-plutonium-gauge-bezel/).

&#9888; The "templates" for the Roentgens meter are scanned from two different model 49 packages. For unknown reasons they differ. Use "roentgens_dimensions.png" for reference, this is official Simpson data.
