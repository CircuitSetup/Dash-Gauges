Beware: The "templates" for the Roentgens meter are scanned from two different model 49 packages. For some reason they differ. Use "dimensions" for reference, this is official Simpson data.

The DWG files were made based on the measurements in the png files (which in turn are proven to be acurate). Please check the dwgs on paper before having the bezel made in metal. If you find errors, please do not hesisate to open an issue or a discussion thread.
