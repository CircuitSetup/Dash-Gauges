&#9888; The measurements in the PNG file are proven to be accurate, bezels were made based on those. The DWG file was made based on the measurements in the PNGs but was not yet used to produce bezels. Please check the DWG on paper before having the bezel made in metal. If you find errors, please open an issue or a discussion thread. If you want to save yourself the trouble, you can buy the complete bezel at [CircuitSetup](https://circuitsetup.us/product/delorean-time-machine-dash-plutonium-gauge-bezel/).

Files in "Model 142" folder are for bezels for Model 142 VU meters as "Roentgens" meter.

&#9888; The "templates" for the Roentgens meter are scanned from two different model 29 packages. For unknown reasons they differ. Use "roentgens_dimensions.png" for reference, this is official Simpson data.
