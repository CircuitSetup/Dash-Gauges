This "ring" elevates the front of a non-illuminated model x9 Simpson meter in order to make room for the Empty light and the red pointer, and it allows for easily adding illumination.

Required screw type for the meter's enclosure with the extension ring installed: UNC 3-48 1/2" with a suitable flat head.
