The cut lines on all templates are _outside_ of the area to cut out. The labels are meant to be applied as follows:
- Phaostron, Roentgens: Cut right hand side and bottom as close as possible the cut marks (so that they ever so slightly _outside_ of the final label). Leave extra on top and left hand side. Then apply label, bottom right aligned, an "L"-shaped ruler helps. Finally cut surplus on left hand side and top with a fresh Exacto knife.
- Empty: Cut all four sides as close as possible to to the cut lines.

Roentgens: Model 49 meters have two upper screw positions. Choose the "upper screws" version if the screws holding the dial are near the top edge.
